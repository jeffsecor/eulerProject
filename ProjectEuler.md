# Project Euler Solutions in Python
Questions from Euler Project posted here for record.  These were all done using a Python's __Integrated Development and Learning Environment__ using Python version 3.6.4.  

## Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5 
This is a simple problem to start the coding challenge.  The main concept is to use the modulo operator, and that variable comparison uses double equal signs.  An one line solution using a python _"list comprehension"_  is 
```
print(sum([x for x in range(1,1000) if x%3==0 or x%5==0 ]))

```

An oldschool, but more explicit solution uses variable declaration and a while loop.  
```
x,total = 0,0
while x<1000:
    if x%3==0 or x%5==0:
        total+=x
    x+=1
print(total)
```

## Problem 2 - 
The Fibbonacci series is a beautiful mathematical entity. It is generated by adding the two subsequent terms. It is found in all areas of nature and science.  The question here is 
+to find the sum of even terms less than 4,000,000.  The Fibbonnacci sequence leads to a very instructive coding lesson in how to re-assign
+variables without creating an infinite list of them.  Here, we need to seed the function with the numbers "a,b=1,1".  Then we can 
+move through the list with the values "a+b".
```
a,b,,total=1,1,0,
while (a+b) < 4000000:
    if (a+b)%2==0:
        total+=(a+b)
    a,b=b,a+b
print(total)
```
