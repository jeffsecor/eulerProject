This problem asks to find the largest palindromic number which is the product of two 3 digit numbers, or the numbers 100 through 999).
A straightforward approach is to make a string of each product, check if its a palindrome, then check if its bigger than the ones before it.  
The challenge here is that you need to scan through all of the possible values for each number in the product.  But since were looking for the largest,
it makes sence to start with the largest possible value for each number and then work backwards.  We break the y loop once we find a palindrome because
any smaller value of y must give a smaller product.  However, it is possible that a smaller value of x and larger value of y gives a larger palindrome, so we 
run through the whole list of values for x.  However, I just realized, that by recording the value of y that gives the largest palindrome, you could
stop the x loop once it falls to that value since multiplication is symmetric.
```
p=0
x=999
while x>99:
    y=x-1
    while y>99:
        num = x*y
        if list(str(num))[0]==list(str(num))[len(str(num))-1]
        and list(str(num))[1]==list(str(num))[len(str(num))-2]
        and list(str(num))[2]==list(str(num))[len(str(num))-3]:
            if num>p:
                p=num
            break
        else:
          y=y-1
    x=x-1

print(p)
```
