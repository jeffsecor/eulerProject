The Fibbonacci series is a beautiful mathematical entity. It is generated by adding the two subsequent terms. It is found in all areas of nature and science.  The question here is 
to find the sum of even terms less than 4,000,000.  The Fibbonnacci sequence leads to a very instructive coding lesson in how to re-assign
variables without creating an infinite list of them.  Here, we need to seed the function with the numbers "a,b=1,1".  Then we can 
move through the list with the values "a+b".
```
a,b,,total=1,1,0,
while (a+b) < 4000000:
    if (a+b)%2==0:
        total+=(a+b)
    a,b=b,a+b
print(total)
```
